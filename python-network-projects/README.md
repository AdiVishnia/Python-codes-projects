# Python Network Projects

This directory contains small Python networking projects.

## Server_Client Project
Basic TCP clientâ€“server example.
- `Server.py`: Listens for connections and handles client requests.
- `Client.py`: Connects to the server and sends data/requests.
- `payload.txt`: Sample content to transfer.

Usage notes:
- Start `Server.py` first, then run `Client.py` from the same machine or network.
- Port and IP are configured in code; adjust as needed.

These examples practice core networking concepts: sockets, routing, and ARP tables.
