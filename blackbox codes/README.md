# Blackbox Codes

This directory contains small, self‑contained scripts and examples related to networking, encoding/decoding, hashing, and brute‑force demonstrations. These are intended for learning and research in a controlled environment.

Important: Use only on systems and data you own or have explicit permission to test. Follow local laws and organizational policies.

## blackbox1
- `find_admin_token_using_base64.py`: Demonstrates extracting/decoding admin tokens using Base64.
- `HTTP_Admin_Request.py`: Sends HTTP requests that simulate/admin‑related access flows.
- `HTTP_HASH_Request.py`: Issues HTTP requests that include or test hashed payloads/parameters.
- `SHA1_hash.py`: Utilities/demos for computing SHA‑1 hashes.

## blackbox2
- `bruteforce_phone_number.py`: Brute‑force example over phone‑number‑like inputs (for demonstration only).
- `clinet_connect_to_server_TCP.py`: Simple TCP client that connects to a server (typo preserved from original file name).

## blackbox6
- `MD5_HASH.py`: Utilities/demos for computing MD5 hashes.
- `TCP_Socket.py`: Basic TCP socket example (connect, send/receive).

## blackbox7
- `bruteforce_checksum.py`: Demonstrates brute‑forcing to match a simple checksum.
- `data_base.py`: Helper/storage routines used by the checksum demo.

## SYNTAX
Reference snippets and quick demos:
- `base64_decode_example.py`: Base64 decode example.
- `check_port80.bat`: Quick script to check port 80 availability.
- `Hash_Bruteforce.py`: Hash brute‑force demonstration.
- `http_request.py`: Minimal HTTP request example.
- `info.json`: Sample JSON for testing.
- `subprocess_bruteforce.py`: Spawning subprocesses to parallelize brute‑force attempts (demo only).
- `TCP_Socket.py`, `UDP_Socket.py`: Minimal TCP/UDP socket examples.

Notes
- Update host/port/paths in scripts before running.
- Some examples may require Administrator/Root privileges.
- Always test in an isolated lab environment.
