# Python Security Projects

A collection of security-oriented learning tools and red‑team exercises.

Main sub‑projects live under `src/`: basic antivirus, network attacks, keylogger, and RAT demos (keyboard/mouse/screen).

Important: Use strictly in controlled environments on systems you own or have explicit permission to test. You are fully responsible for compliance and lawful use.

See `src/README.md` for details and run notes per module.
