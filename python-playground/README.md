# Python Playground

A sandbox for Python practice: data structures, exercises, and file processing.

## data_structures
Practice with common data structures:
- `data structures_practice.py`: Lists, arrays, and dictionaries.
- `dictionery_practice.py`: Working with dicts (insert/update/search).
- `hash.py`: Simple hashing/mapping of keys to values.
- `list-dictionary practice.py`: Combining lists and dictionaries.

## exercises
Assorted exercises:
- `binary  exercise/Negative_binary_representation.py`: Binary representation of negative numbers.
- `calculator_practice.py`: Basic calculator; input/output and arithmetic.
- `classTask.py`: Classes, attributes, and methods.
- `CodingTask1.py`, `CodingTask2.py`: General coding tasks.
- `Home_practice.py`: Mixed practice tasks.
- `PasswordChecker.py`: Simple password strength/validation checks.
- `sys exercise/Word_Frequency_Counter.py`: Word frequency counter for `sys exercise/Word_Frequency_text.txt`.

Notes:
- Run each exercise as a standalone script and read inline comments if present.
- Some examples expect input files in the same directory.
